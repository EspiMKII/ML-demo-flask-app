I am building a flask app to demonstrate a few ML models working on stock price datas. To sum up, the features so far are:

1. Input page
- Choose model (dropdown list)
- Choose ticker (dropdown list): GOOG and GE
- Choose time steps (dropdown list): currently, have 1, 5, 10 and 365 days
- Choose other performance metrics to be shown (tickbox for each? is there a more elegant solution?): Root square mean error, Residual, Mean absolute percentage error
2. Output page
- Comparison graph (mandatory)
- Show RMSE
- Show Residual
- Show MAPE
last 3 are optional and should be hidden as necessary
