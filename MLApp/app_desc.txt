1. Input page
- Choose model (dropdown list)
- Choose time steps (dropdown list): currently, have 1, 5, 10 and 365 daysshown (tickbox for each? is there a more elegant solution?): Root square mean error, R^2 Score, Mean absolute percentage error
- Choose other performance metrics to be 
2. Output page
- Comparison graph (mandatory)
- Show RMSE
- Show R^2 Score
- Show MAPE
last 3 are optional and should be hidden as necessary
- should have a button that redirects back to input page
